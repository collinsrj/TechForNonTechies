# TechForNonTechies

## Prerequisites

* No background in programming required
* No software needs to be installed. All coding is done using [repl.it](https://repl.it).
* Programming will be done in Python

## Goals

* A whistle stop tour of the life a program
* Give the absolute basics of programming
* Each class broken up into two sections:
	* Background
	* Coding tutorial
* At the end you should be able to call an API and do something with the response
* Teach programming concepts while teaching standard practices within Mastercard

## Week 1

### The Basics

### What is a computer?

### What is an operating system?

#### A brief history and the Pirates of Silicon Valley

Introduction to the early OS wars involving Xerox, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, etc.

#### Components of an OS

* Kernel
* Interrupts
* Memory management
* Thread management
* File organization
	* Command line exercises to navigate the directory tree
* User interface



### What is a program?

### Programming languages

* Common characteristics of programming languages
	* We can focus on Python language features since we're going to be doing exercises
	* Compare python with other languages (e.g. C++, Java, Ruby)
	* Explain what domains each language might be used for (C++ embedded systems, Java microservices, Javascript front end web pages, Python + data science / ML)
	* Exerices related to this?
		* Match a code snippet with functionality / feature
		* Identify the language feature (e.g. For Loop, function definition)
* Type systems
* Compilers

### Exercises

#### Quizzes
* Simple quizes to reinforce the information presented
* Quiz before and after each session

#### "Hello world"

#### Input and Output

Implement in python, but show implementations in other languages e.g. C, Javascript, R, Erlang, to cover different programming paradigms, OO, Functional, Logical, Procedural

#### Iterate over a list

## Week 2

### Development Environments

* Dependency management
	* Python - pip / PyPI
	* NodeJS - npm
	* Java, Scala, Kotlin - Maven, Gradle
	* Ruby - RubyGems

* Why use dependency management?
* What is git and version control?
* 

### Where is code stored?


### Frameworks

* What is a library?
	* Spring Boot
		* Goal to reduce boilerplate or ramp-up of a project
* Packaging libraries/frameworks
* Distributing libraries/frameworks
	* Artifactory

### Exercises

* Walkthrough of a sample Spring Boot project
	* Look at pom.xml OR build.gradle
	* Look at src/main/java directory
	* Where are classes saved
	* Building an application

#### Types and variables

## Week 3

### Running software

* Pivotal Cloud Foundry
	* Sample push application
	* Pipelines
* Jenkins
* CI/CD

	
### The cloud

### Exercises

#### Dictionaries
* Iterate over values in a dictionary

## Week 4

### How does the internet work?

* Show the basics of an HTTP request?
* What are microservices?
* What is an API?

### Exercises

#### Call an API

* Make a call to the DarkSky API to retrieve the weather for Dublin
* Do something with the result (e.g. get the max wind speed for the day)

* **Advanced**: call a Mastercard API
	* Requires using the OAuth signer

### Summary of learning

#### Goals
* Graduates should be able to identify terminology
	* API
	* JSON
	* Keys
	* XML
	* Git
	* Maven, Gradle
	* Microservices
* Relate what they learned in the course to their daily work lives
* Capstone project 
	* DarkSky API integration

### Tools

* Repl.it
* Jupyter?
* Documentation!
